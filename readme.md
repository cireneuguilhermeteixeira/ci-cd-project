**Challenge: Setting up Jenkins CI/CD Pipeline for a Node.js Application**

 - Description:

In this challenge, you will be required to set up a Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline for a Node.js application using Jenkins. This pipeline will automate the building, testing, and deployment of the application.

- Steps:

    - Set up a Jenkins server and create a new Jenkins job.
    - Configure the job to pull the source code from a Git repository.
    - Configure Jenkins to build the Node.js application using a build script.
    - Set up automated testing for the application using a testing framework such as Mocha.
    - Configure Jenkins to deploy the application to a test environment after successful testing.
    - Set up automated deployment to the production environment after successful testing in the test environment.
    - Add code quality checks using a tool such as ESLint.
    - Create a report for the job and configure notifications for success or failure.


- Deliverables:

    - A working Jenkins CI/CD pipeline for the Node.js application.
    - A report detailing the steps taken to set up the pipeline, including any issues encountered and how they were resolved.
    - Code quality checks and testing reports.
    - The Git repository for the Node.js application with the pipeline configuration files included.


- Additional Information:

You may use any Node.js application for this challenge. Ensure that the application has a build script and unit tests. You may use any Jenkins plugins required to complete the challenge. Ensure that all configuration files are properly documented, and best practices are followed.
